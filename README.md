# About hook.io-ring

hook.io-ring provides a RingNode and corresponding RingClient hook.  RingNodes automatically announce their presence in the ring
when started, as well as inform any new RingClients that may join.  Out of the box, the hash ring that is formed has no functionality,
but by subclassing these hooks, they can be utilized to assist in a variety of use cases.
